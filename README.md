## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this challenge I learned fluid typography in greater detail and using that same prinicple changing padding and width of elements to make them reponsive. This helped in writing less media query and making the responsivness more fluid.



### Useful resources

- [Designing Beautiful Shadows in CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/) - I was very impressed by how much there is to shadows. I learned a lot from Josh Comeau's blog how to approach this tool. I still need to learn and practice more, but this was a good start. My previous experience with shadows was just pluging in numbers and not give it much thought. That didn't help with matching the design of this challenge which led to the discovery of this blog on shadows.
- [Mark Bacon's clamp function calculator](https://www.marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/) - My understanding of the clamp function was greatly increased by this challenge. I made extensive use of this function in this challenge. But finding the right middle value was a lot of work at first. Then I found this resource by Mark Bacon that simplified the process.
